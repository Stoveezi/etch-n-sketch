This is a html page that uses simple jquery and css to create a basic
etch-n-sketch pad.  It defaults to a 4 x 4 grid, and each square in the grid
will turn black when the mouse enters it.  There are two buttons that change
the coloring style when the mouse enters a square.  One randomizes the color
completely, the other increases the darkness of a square by 10%, up to 100%.
